# Testing Values

Why it's important to state the testing values of a project.

What our values are.

Code is a liability, not an asset. A small number of highly valuable tests will do a much better job protecting the project from bugs than a large number of mediocre tests. They couple tests to the classâ€™s implementation details, as opposed to its observable behavior.

Mocks aren't your friend. Mostly. This is the road to brittle tests, paved with good intentions.


How you can observe these values in action.

These values drew heavy inspiration from Clarity, TDD what when wrong and the book.
